## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance classification accuracy using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** by applying **hyperparameter tuning** techniques. The implementation is based on the foundational work by Cortes & Vapnik (1995) on Support Vector Networks.

The project demonstrates:
- Understanding of SVM theory and kernel functions.
- Practical implementation of SVM using Python.
- Techniques for improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

---

## Motivation
Support Vector Machines are widely used in classification problems due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and robust performance. However, their performance heavily depends on proper **hyperparameter selection** (e.g., kernel type, regularization parameter, gamma). This project explores these aspects to maximize classification accuracy.

---

## Research Gap
While the original SVM paper proposed a robust framework, there are areas for improvement in real-world applications:
- Optimal hyperparameter selection for different datasets.
- Handling non-linear and high-dimensional data efficiently.
- Balancing model complexity and generalization.

This project focuses on bridging these gaps by systematically tuning hyperparameters and evaluating their impact on model accuracy.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, scaling, and splitting data into training and test sets.
2. **SVM Model Implementation:** Using Python's `scikit-learn` library.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search and cross-validation to select the best combination of parameters.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5. **Analysis:** Comparing results before and after tuning.

---

## Dataset
The project can be applied to any classification dataset. For demonstration, commonly used datasets like **Iris** dataset is used.

**Features:**
- Numerical attributes representing classes.
- Multi-class or binary classification tasks.

## Implementation
```python
# Example: SVM Implementation with Hyperparameter Tuning
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Define SVM model
svm_model = SVC()

# Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],
    'kernel': ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto']
}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm_model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)

print("Best Parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
